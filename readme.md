# Trading App

Deployed to: 
https://limitless-garden-47986.herokuapp.com/

A fullstack CRUD app that allows users to post products for trade, and barter with other users.

## MVP:
- Splash page.
- User auth. Register and log in.  Also include 'forgot password' link, and password changing (perhaps on a user settings page)
- View own inventory.  Add and delete one's own listings.  Items should have images.
- View all available listings.  These should be all of the items available for trade that don't belong to the user.
- View a single item detail page.  If the item belongs to the user, they should be able to toggle the item's trade availability.
- Offer a trade for another listing.  One item should be offered for one other item.
- Ability to view pending trades and accept trades, so that the items switch inventories.
- Users cannot offer the same item in different trades.
- If different user offer to trade for the same item, and one of those trades are accepted, the other trades should be immediately canceled.
- Sort and filter items.

> More Features:
- Allow group trades (offer one or more items for one or more items)
- Track user's trade history.
- Send email notifications when things happen (trades offered, accepted, declined, etc.)
- Email confirmation.
- Use standard submission procedures.
